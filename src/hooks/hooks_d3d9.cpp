// D3D9 entry-point hooks — observation only.
//
// The title statically links D3D9 v2.0.20209.3, so these functions are in the
// XEX but were nameless until an XDK d3d9.lib was matched against it by bytes
// (see "The D3D9 entry points are located" in AGENTS.md, and
// tools/match_d3d9.py). The control for that match was D3DDevice_Swap, whose
// COMDAT is 0x684 bytes — the exact size of the already-confirmed
// sub_82566B58, and its pattern matched that address and nothing else.
//
// Why this is worth hooking at all: every colour round so far has inferred
// vertex layout from PM4 and shader microcode, because on Xenos a vfetch
// carries format and offset but not semantic. The semantics exist one layer
// up, in the D3DVERTEXELEMENT9 arrays the game hands to
// D3DDevice_CreateVertexDeclaration. They are not static data — four different
// 12-byte D3DDECL_END sentinels return zero matches binary-wide — so the only
// way to see them is to catch them being built.
//
// Everything here passes through to the original and changes no guest state.
// The point of this round is two numbers and one table:
//
//   1. What the declarations actually are.
//   2. Whether the D3D9 draw count matches the translator's transcoded draw
//      count. 53 static call sites are consistent with thousands of draws per
//      frame, but that is an inference; these counters test it.
